# Material Design Icons: SVG Sprites 24px

_**Why?**_ - _Because Google refuses to put the iconsets into separate repositories._

Using npm or bower installation will not install the html previews.

#### npm
```
npm install md-icons-svg-sprites-24px
```
#### Bower
```
bower install md-icons-svg-sprites-24px
